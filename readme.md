# THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FORK

Feel free to use, this currently has post effects and other wip features that are yet to be integrated into the [main branch](https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron). I actively perform with this branch and can confirm it's stability on windows, but features are subject to change.

# Hedron

## Getting Started

### Install
A compiled version is not currently available to download, so you'll need to download the source and compile yourself.

1. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) are installed on your machine.
2. Open terminal and run the commands below.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron.git
$ cd hedron
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

`yarn start` opens the app in dev mode, you'll probably want to close the dev tools on the right hand side of the window.

Run `yarn dist` to package up the app for best performance and no dev tools. Once the build is complete, you'll find the app inside `/dist`.

### Load trippy example project

1. Choose "Load Existing Project". Locate the repo directory. Open `example-projects/trippy/project.json`
2. An alert will appear. Choose "Locate Sketch Folder" and open `/example-projects/trippy/sketches`
3. Play it some music, tap BPM, experiment with the controls
4. 😎

## Contributing to Hedron

If you are having fun with Hedron, we'd love you to help with development. See the repo [issues](https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron/issues) for what needs doing. We're particularly looking for developers who know about:

- React/Redux
- three.js/WebGL
- Javascript performance
- Spout/Syphon/C++ ([related issue](https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron/issues/21))
- Audio analysis ([related issue](https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron/issues/8))

### How to contribute

- Fork a branch from dev
- Make changes
- Ensure tests are passing
- Make a pull request to dev

### Dev scripts
| script | description |
|--|--|
| `yarn start` | Run in dev mode |
| `yarn dist` | Package the app |
| `yarn dist:dev` | Run a production build without packaging. Behaves similarly to `yarn start` in that it will look for a default project and open Chrome DevTools automatically. However it will not do any sort of live refreshing. |
| `yarn lint` | Run linting |
| `yarn test` | Run pre deployment tests (including linting) |
| `yarn test:dev` | Run tests on file changes (does not include linting) |
